# SpaceEngineers OreDetector Raycast
Adds Raycast to MyOreDetector for In-game scripts.

A low level functionality that allows in-game scripts to use the ore detector to shoot out rays,
which return the name and distance of the ore it hits.

Does not detect ore patch extent.
Does not detect in surrounding sphere or give info about the base game's automatically detected patches.

Based on IMyCameraBlock's Raycast functionality, similar charge limitation. (2km/s)
